# Bid Ball

This is a sports "betting" app (not real currency), in a similar style to DraftKings or FanDuel. Users will be able to signup/login and view all current sports games for the day. Users can make their picks on what team(s) they think will win and place a bet. Users will gain or lose virtual currency based on correct/incorrect picks. Users can view their current balance, favorite team/sport, and their stats. Games will be updated each day using a third-party api to retrieve game data.
